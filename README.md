# Cleaning-Code-Project

This is what was used to clean the data set for galaxy sII experiment. The way this dataset works is if 
you put the data in your working directory in R the run_analysis.R file will look for them appropriately.
The R code is made such that you have no need to mess with any of the files. Ideally you can clone this
repo and then run the run_analysis.R file and have a new file called "tidy.data.txt" that would be the processed called
dataset.

Attached in this repo is a codebook that explains all of the things that I did to modify the data and why.
The code book is called CodeBook.md is should be within this repo, please refer to it for a description of
the run_analysis.R file and its output.
